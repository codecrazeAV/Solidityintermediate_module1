<h1>Solidity intermediate module 1 </h1>

This Solidity program is a simple "solidity" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of a error handling which can be deployed with the help of a smart contract. The purpose of this program is to serve as an exmaple implementation of revert, asert and require functions used in error handling.

<h2>Description</h2>
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This program has a contract named ErrorHandlingExample. The contract has 5 functions- buy tokens, sell tokens, deposit, withdraw and transfer.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Executing program</h3>
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ABC.sol). Copy the code  which you can find in the file named Solidity_intermediate_module1_finalproject.sol attached in this github repository, annd paste it into the file created by you.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" version is set to "0.8.0" (or later), and then click on the "Compile ABC.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ErrorhandlingExample" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling all mentioned functions.

Now scroll up, just below Account you can see list of addresses written in hexadecimal, click that, you can see a list of addresses in the dropdown menu. Just copy one of them and paste that in the box near the balances. And click on balances, it will show you the current balance. Which should be 0. Since no transactions have been done so far. Now, expand the deposit function to depsit some balance. Enter any amount and click on deposit. Then you can call functions like Transfer, withdraw or buy tokens with the balance you have or sell token and get the deducted amount back to your account balance. You should keep in mind if you want to buy a token or transfer some amount you need to have sufficient balance into your tokbalance or balance respectively. And you can't transfer more than 100 at one time.
